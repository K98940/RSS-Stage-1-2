#### Hi! My name is Konstantin. I'm from Omsk.
In 1998 graduated from the Siberian Professional College, specializing in programming. A programmer in Pascal üòÑ   
Even in 1998, it was not considered cool, and I never received an offer in my field.   
Twenty-three years have passed...

In 2021, on one day, I needed to edit an HTML document. I had no knowledge about HTML. After doing some research on the issue, I resolved my problem. However, I wanted more. I became interested in this subject and started learning **HTML**, then **CSS** ‚Äì I was pleased when I changed the text color to red, then **JavaScript** and my first ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in JavaScript. It has become a hobby of mine.

One day, I saw in the comments on YouTube a mention of RS School.   
I realized that I would not be able to devote the necessary amount of time to learning, and decided to complete Stage 0 without registering at my own pace.   
I completed the Stage 0 course and then started working on my pet project. I wanted to create an assistant application for myself, but besides the front-end, I also needed a back-end.   
I started learning **Node JS** and it was really hard. A few months later, I had a working prototype on my home computer.   
I was also interested in **PHP**, and after a few months, I rewrote my project using PHP. It turned out to be very easy. PHP is very simple for beginners to learn.   
Then, I started studying **React** and rewrote the client-side part of my project in React.   
It was summer 2023 and I was ready to go. I signed up for stage 0 and completed it in 84th place.   
**I'm here now. Stage1**‚Ä¶

And of course, I have another favorite hobby - cycling.   
I even participate in local amateur competitions, which is very exciting. Right now, I don't have a lot of free time, but I continue my exercise routine to keep myself fit. Because I'm going to need it.   
After all, I plan to continue my studies.   
Before **TypeScript** and immersion in React, I will work on my weaknesses: *object-oriented programming, algorithms, and English* üòâ   
And of course, searching for a team that will be my dream team, in which I will be able to realize my skills and gain new knowledge.   
Thanks for your attention ‚úã
