## Reflections

1. I am starting to realize that I need to learn TypeScript.
2. `:number` and `:string` became my best friends. When I created an `enum`, I felt, "Wow, I know TypeScript now."
3. My experience has increased. Level 3 is coming soon! I will become an App crafter.
4. Now I can use `Type` and `Interface` for my Apps.
5. It was really exciting. I hope that, over time, I will understand it better.
6. The level of misunderstanding is close to critical.
7. Lastly, an easy subject comes after generic.
8. I met with the ancient practice of namespaces, and have got a [sign](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/K98940/UF5MJYC3?sharingId=220BBAB425956B74)
